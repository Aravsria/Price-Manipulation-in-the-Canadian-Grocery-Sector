Instruction 1: Drop unnecessary columns in the raw_df
The first step was to remove any unnecessary columns from the dataset, such as the 'price_per_unit', which was assumed not to be needed for this analysis.

Code:

python
Copy code
# 1. Drop unnecessary columns in the raw_df
raw_df_cleaned = raw_df.drop(columns=['price_per_unit'])  # Assuming 'price_per_unit' is not needed for this analysis

Instruction 2: Handle missing values in 'current_price' and 'old_price' columns
For missing values in the 'current_price' and 'old_price' columns, the forward-fill method (ffill) was applied to fill these missing values based on the previous valid entry.

Code:

python
Copy code
# 2. Handle missing values in 'current_price' and 'old_price' columns
raw_df_cleaned['current_price'].fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)  # Forward fill missing current prices
raw_df_cleaned['old_price'].fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)  # Forward fill missing old prices

Instruction 3: Convert 'nowtime' to datetime
The 'nowtime' column was converted to a datetime format to facilitate time-based analysis.

Code:

python
Copy code
# 3. Convert 'nowtime' to datetime
raw_df_cleaned['nowtime'] = pd.to_datetime(raw_df_cleaned['nowtime'])


Instruction 4: Ensure 'current_price' and 'old_price' are numeric
The 'current_price' and 'old_price' columns were converted to numeric data types. Any values that couldn’t be converted were set to NaN using the errors='coerce' argument.

Code:

python
Copy code
# 4. Ensure 'current_price' and 'old_price' are numeric
raw_df_cleaned['current_price'] = pd.to_numeric(raw_df_cleaned['current_price'], errors='coerce')
raw_df_cleaned['old_price'] = pd.to_numeric(raw_df_cleaned['old_price'], errors='coerce')


Instruction 5: Merge raw_df with product_df
The cleaned dataset (raw_df_cleaned) was merged with product_df based on the matching 'product_id' from raw_df and 'id' from product_df to enrich the dataset with product-related information.

Code:

python
Copy code
# Merge with product_df on 'product_id' from raw_df and 'id' from product_df
merged_df = pd.merge(raw_df_cleaned, product_df, left_on='product_id', right_on='id', how='left')


Instruction 6: Drop irrelevant columns in the merged dataframe
Irrelevant columns such as 'id', 'concatted', 'brand', 'detail_url', 'sku', and 'upc' were dropped from the merged dataset to keep the analysis focused on the most useful data.

Code:

python
Copy code
# 5. Drop irrelevant columns in the merged dataframe (e.g., 'id', 'concatted', 'brand', 'detail_url', 'sku', 'upc')
merged_df_cleaned = merged_df.drop(columns=['id', 'concatted', 'brand', 'detail_url', 'sku', 'upc'])


Instruction 7: Drop rows with missing 'current_price' or 'product_name'
Rows with missing values in critical columns such as 'current_price' and 'product_name' were removed to ensure data integrity and avoid incomplete records.

Code:

python
Copy code
# 6. Drop rows with missing 'current_price' or 'product_name'
merged_df_cleaned = merged_df_cleaned.dropna(subset=['current_price', 'product_name'])


Instruction 8: Sort the data by 'product_id' and 'nowtime'
The dataset was sorted by 'product_id' and 'nowtime' to ensure that data is organized chronologically within each product group.

Code:

python
Copy code
# 7. Sort the data by 'product_id' and 'nowtime'
merged_df_cleaned.sort_values(by=['product_id', 'nowtime'], ascending=[True, False], inplace=True)


Instruction 9: Create columns to track price trends before and after sales
New columns were created to track the price changes before and after sales for each product using the .shift() method to reference previous and next price values.

Code:

python
Copy code
# 8. Create columns to track price trends before and after sales
merged_df_cleaned['pre_sale_price'] = merged_df_cleaned.groupby('product_id')['current_price'].shift(-1)
merged_df_cleaned['post_sale_price'] = merged_df_cleaned.groupby('product_id')['current_price'].shift(1)


Instruction 10: Filter the rows where 'other' column indicates 'SALE'
The dataset was filtered to include only the rows where the 'other' column indicates a sale, creating a subset of the data specifically focused on sales.

Code:

python
Copy code
# 9. Filter the rows where 'other' column indicates 'SALE'
sale_df = merged_df_cleaned[merged_df_cleaned['other'] == 'SALE']
Instruction 11: Set 'nowtime' as the index for resampling
The 'nowtime' column was set as the index to facilitate time-based resampling for aggregating the data at a monthly frequency.

Code:

python
Copy code
# Set 'nowtime' column as the index for resampling
merged_df_cleaned['nowtime'] = pd.to_datetime(merged_df_cleaned['nowtime'])
merged_df_cleaned.set_index('nowtime', inplace=True)
Instruction 12: Resample data monthly for time series analysis
The data was resampled monthly using the 'nowtime' index, and the mean of the numeric columns, including 'current_price', was calculated for each month.

Code:

python
Copy code
# 1. Monthly Time Series for Current Price (corrected for resampling with 'nowtime' as index)
numeric_columns = merged_df_cleaned.select_dtypes(include=['number']).columns
monthly_data = merged_df_cleaned[numeric_columns].resample('M').mean()

# Plot Monthly Average Current Price
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.lineplot(data=monthly_data, x=monthly_data.index, y='current_price')
plt.title('Monthly Average Current Price')
plt.xlabel('Month')
plt.ylabel('Average Price')
plt.show()
Instruction 13: Extract year and month and group by 'year_month'
The 'nowtime' column was used to extract the year and month for further grouping and aggregating of the data based on monthly price trends.

Code:

python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Convert 'nowtime' to datetime format if not already
merged_df_cleaned['nowtime'] = pd.to_datetime(merged_df_cleaned['nowtime'])

# Step 2: Extract year and month from 'nowtime' column
merged_df_cleaned['year_month'] = merged_df_cleaned['nowtime'].dt.to_period('M')
Instruction 14: Group by 'year_month' and calculate the mean price before and after sales
The dataset was grouped by the extracted 'year_month' column, and the average prices before and after sales were calculated.

Code:

python
Copy code
# Step 3: Group by year_month and calculate the mean price before and after sales
monthly_prices = merged_df_cleaned.groupby('year_month').agg({
    'price_change_before_sale': 'mean',
    'price_change_after_sale': 'mean'
}).reset_index()
Instruction 15: Plot the time series for prices before and after sales
A line plot was created to visualize the price trends before and after sales, with separate lines for each trend.

Code:

python
Copy code
# Step 4: Plotting the time series for prices before and after sale
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(monthly_prices['year_month'].astype(str), monthly_prices['price_change_before_sale'], label='Price Before Sale', color='blue', marker='o')
plt.plot(monthly_prices['year_month'].astype(str), monthly_prices['price_change_after_sale'], label='Price After Sale', color='red', marker='o')

# Step 5: Formatting the plot
plt.title('Price Trends Before and After Sales (Monthly)', fontsize=14)
plt.xlabel('Month', fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel('Price ($)', fontsize=12)
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)

# Step 6: Show the plot
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

Instruction 15:

User: here's my paper in it's current state, I need to include a small paragraph on measurement talking about how we go from a phenomena in the world to an entry in the dataset. 

ChatGPT: 

Measurement
The process of measurement in this study involves translating real-world events and phenomena into quantifiable and structured data entries. This is achieved by systematically collecting data on key economic and geopolitical factors influencing [your specific focus, e.g., crude oil prices, grocery pricing, etc.]. For instance, raw data such as daily commodity prices, recorded from authoritative sources like [specific dataset source, e.g., FRED, online scraping, etc.], are cleaned and organized to represent fluctuations, trends, and events. Variables such as [example variable 1] and [example variable 2] are derived through mathematical transformations or categorizations to encapsulate complex processes, like short-term volatility or political events, into measurable formats. This approach bridges the gap between dynamic real-world interactions and the static data needed for analysis, enabling a structured exploration of the studied phenomena.

This provides a brief yet precise explanation for how data is transformed from real-world events into analyzable formats. Let me know if you'd like adjustments or a more detailed explanation!

ChatGPT:

The error indicates that the vendor column in your merged_df_cleaned DataFrame contains duplicate values, which causes problems when sns.barplot tries to aggregate the data for plotting. Seaborn's barplot assumes that the x values (here, vendor) are unique or can be grouped without ambiguity.

Here’s how to address this issue:

1. Check for Duplicates in the vendor Column
Run the following code to check if the vendor column contains duplicates:

python
Copy code
print(merged_df_cleaned['vendor'].value_counts())
If duplicates exist, Seaborn's barplot is likely trying to aggregate y values (e.g., current_price or old_price) for duplicate vendor entries, which might be problematic.

2. Aggregate Data to Handle Duplicates
You need to summarize the data so that each vendor has a single corresponding value for current_price and old_price. Use the groupby method to calculate the mean (or another statistic) for each vendor:

python
Copy code
# Aggregate data
vendor_avg_prices = merged_df_cleaned.groupby('vendor', as_index=False).agg({
    'current_price': 'mean',
    'old_price': 'mean'
})
Now vendor_avg_prices contains unique vendor entries with their average prices, making it suitable for plotting.

3. Modify the Bar Plot Code
Update the plotting code to use the aggregated DataFrame:

python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Plot Vendor vs Current Price
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(data=vendor_avg_prices, x='vendor', y='current_price')
plt.title('Vendor vs Current Price')
plt.xlabel('Vendor')
plt.ylabel('Average Current Price')
plt.show()

# Plot Vendor vs Old Price
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(data=vendor_avg_prices, x='vendor', y='old_price')
plt.title('Vendor vs Old Price')
plt.xlabel('Vendor')
plt.ylabel('Average Old Price')
plt.show()
4. Verify the Data
If you want to ensure the integrity of your data, you can inspect the aggregated DataFrame:

python
Copy code
print(vendor_avg_prices)
5. Alternative: Resolve Duplicate Labels Without Aggregation
If aggregation is not desired and duplicates in vendor are valid, you can try using sns.catplot with kind='bar' instead. It handles duplicates differently:

python
Copy code
sns.catplot(data=merged_df_cleaned, x='vendor', y='current_price', kind='bar', height=6, aspect=2)
However, for bar charts, aggregation is typically more appropriate.

These changes should resolve the error and allow you to generate your bar charts. Let me know if you encounter further issues!
